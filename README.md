Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of the Project
This project aims to assess how different campaigns fared about the launch dates and their funding goals. The analysis is informed by the results obtained by Louise’s Fever, which were very close to the fundraising goal in a short period. Therefore, a dataset about the performance of different campaigns was collected and analyzed using a variety of visualization to examine the respective launch dates and funding goals. The study also looks at the overall analysis and challenges in the exercise.

### Analysis and Challenges
The first analysis was performed using Pivot Table and Line Chart from Microsoft Excel software. First, data about the different campaigns were collected, cleaned and organized using Excel pivot tables as shown in Figure 1 below;

Further, the variables were categorized as successful, failed and canceled Kickstarter. In each case, the participant was organized and sorted into tabular formats before being analyzed. Then, the participant was able to use the line chart to see the result displays change over time. 
The second analysis was done using line charts and related functions, including descriptive statistics, to draw a meaningful explanation for the objective of the study. Figure 2 shows the outcomes based on goals of data ready for interpretation;

#### Challenges:
However, there were challenges in building a detailed pivot table. As such, it was confusing at first so that it was necessary to learn more about the required skills using online sources. Thus, this enhanced implementation of the study.
Moreover, it was confusing to study the new function, “COUNTIFS()” in this model. The new function itself is long, and building it is time consuming. I tried several times to reach to my final answer, because a little mistake like typo can result in wrong outcomes. Yet, practicing more makes me feel comfortable playing with this big set of data.

##### Results
The results of the analysis were presented in two categories, namely, the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Dates and Outcomes based on goals. 
The analysis on Theatre Outcomes based on Launch Dates are illustrated in Figure 3 below;

Figure 3: Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date
From Figure 3 above, it can be shown that most successful campaigns were mostly reported or launched between May and July as well as the most failed cases. However, those launched from August onwards performed dismally. The same trend is exhibited for the cases launched from March and below. The highest successful and failed outcomes were 111 and 52, respectively. The rate of cancellation was highest among campaigns introduced between April and July.
The results of the outcomes based on goals are illustrated in Figure 4 below.

Figure 4: Outcome Based on Goal
According to Figure 4, the results show that most successful campaigns were based on outcomes between 30,000 and 44,999, while most failed campaigns were between 24,000 and 34,000. The highest percentage of successful and failed goals being 75.81% and 100% scores respectively. Finally, further understanding of the performance of the campaigns can be enhanced by the use of comparative dynamic tables that allows for selective visualization, thus enhancing decision on the subject matter.
###### Limitation and Recommendation:
The dataset contains a large amount of information and numbers, so that it could be hard to follow. Especially, most of the information was not used for analysis.
Line chart is useful for us to see the result displays change over time, but it can also imply more information by its appearance. Yet, there was barely any limitation for this project.Pivot table could be difficult at first to understand. Though pivot tables allow the participant to quickly sort the data into a clear and useful format with the selected and organized data to be shown.
